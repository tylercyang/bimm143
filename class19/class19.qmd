# 1. Investigating pertussis cases by year

Use the `datapasta` package to get the data from [CDC Website](https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/surv-reporting/cases-by-year.html#print)

> Q1. With the help of the R "addin" package datapasta assign the CDC pertussis case number data to a data frame called `cdc` and use ggplot to make a plot of cases numbers over time.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cdc <- data.frame(
                          Year = c(1922L,
                                   1923L,1924L,1925L,1926L,1927L,1928L,

)

head(cdc)
```

Make the ggplot

```{r, results = 'hide'}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
basePertussisPlot <- ggplot(cdc) + 
  aes(Year, No..Reported.Pertussis.Cases) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of Cases", title = "Pertussis Cases by Year (1922-2019)")
```

# 2. A Tale of Two Vaccines (wP & aP)

> Q2. Using the ggplot geom_vline() function add lines to your previous plot for the 1946 introduction of the wP vaccine and the 1996 switch to aP vaccine (see example in the hint below). What do you notice?

```{r}
basePertussisPlot + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1946, linetype = "dashed", col = "blue") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1996, linetype = "dashed", col = "red")
```

> Q3. Describe what happened after the introduction of the aP vaccine? Do you have a possible explanation for the observed trend?

After the introduction of the aP vaccine, the cases for pertussis has started rising again with a peak around 2012 which was the highest since the mid 1960s. This could be from multiple reasons such as hesitancy to vaccinate, bacterial immunity from the vaccine, different variants of the bacteria, etc.

# 3. Exploring CMI-PB Data

The [CMB-PB](https://www.cmi-pb.org/) project provides long term data about the pertussis resurgence.

## The CMI-PB API returns JSON data

```{r, results = 'hide'}
# Allows us to read, write and process JSON data
library(jsonlite)
```

```{r}
subject <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/subject", simplifyVector = TRUE)

head(subject)
```

> Q4. How may aP and wP infancy vaccinated subjects are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(subject$infancy_vac)
```

> Q5. How many Male and Female subjects/patients are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(subject$biological_sex)
```

> Q6. What is the breakdown of race and biological sex (e.g. number of Asian females, White males etc...)?

```{r}
table(subject$race, subject$biological_sex)
```

## Side-Note: Working with dates

```{r, results='hide'}
library(lubridate)
```

```{r}
today()
```

```{r}
today() - ymd("2000-01-01")
```

```{r}
time_length ( today() - ymd("2000-01-01"), "years" )
```

> Q7. Using this approach determine (i) the average age of wP individuals, (ii) the average age of aP individuals; and (iii) are they significantly different?

```{r, results='hide'}
# Use todays date to calculate age in days
subject$age <- today() - ymd(subject$year_of_birth)

library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
# aP data

ap <- subject %>% filter(infancy_vac == "aP")

round( summary( time_length( ap$age, "years" ) ) )

```

```{r}
# wP data

wp <- subject %>% filter(infancy_vac == "wP")

round ( summary( time_length( wp$age, "years") ) )
```

> Q8. Determine the age of all individuals at time of boost?

```{r}
int <- ymd(subject$date_of_boost) - ymd(subject$year_of_birth)
age_at_boost <- time_length(int, "year")
round(age_at_boost)
```

> Q9. With the help of a faceted boxplot (see below), do you think these two groups are significantly different?

```{r}
ggplot(subject) +
  aes(time_length(age, "year"),
      fill=as.factor(infancy_vac)) +
  geom_histogram(show.legend=FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(infancy_vac), nrow=2) 
```

```{r}
# Calculate p-value 
x <- t.test(time_length( wp$age, "years" ),
       time_length( ap$age, "years" ))

x$p.value
```

## Joining Multiple Tables

```{r}
# Complete the API URLs...
specimen <- read_json("http://cmi-pb.org/api/specimen", simplifyVector = TRUE) 
titer <- read_json("http://cmi-pb.org/api/ab_titer", simplifyVector = TRUE) 
```

Use the `dplyr` package in order to join the tables together. 

> Q9. Complete the code to join `specimen` and `subject` tables to make a new merged data frame containing all specimen records along with their associated subject details:

```{r}
# use inner_join()
meta <- inner_join(specimen, subject)
dim(meta)
head(meta)
```

> Q10. Now using the same procedure join meta with titer data so we can further analyze this data in terms of time of visit aP/wP, male/female etc.

```{r}
abdata <- inner_join(titer, meta)
dim(abdata)
```

> Q11. How many specimens (i.e. entries in abdata) do we have for each isotype?

```{r}
table(abdata$isotype)
```

> Q12. What do you notice about the number of visit 8 specimens compared to other visits?

```{r}
table(abdata$visit)
```

There are a lot less visit 8 specimens compared to the other visit specimens.

# 4. Examine IgG1 Ab titer levels

Now using our joined/merged/linked abdata dataset filter() for IgG1 isotype and exclude the small number of visit 8 entries.

```{r}
ig1 <- abdata %>% filter(isotype == "IgG1", visit!=8)
head(ig1)
```

> Q13. Complete the following code to make a summary boxplot of Ab titer levels for all antigens:

```{r}
ggplot(ig1) +
  aes(MFI, antigen) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(visit), nrow=2)
```

Now facet by aP and wP.

```{r}
ggplot(ig1) +
  aes(MFI, antigen) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(infancy_vac))
```


> Q14. What antigens show differences in the level of IgG1 antibody titers recognizing them over time? Why these and not others?

The FIM2/3 antigens show differences in the level of IgG1 antibody titers recognizing them.
